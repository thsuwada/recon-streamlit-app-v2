
Block Chain - 

Blockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated. It is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in it.

In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous computers in a network, in which the transactional records are stored based on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they canâ€™t corrupt it.
